	abstract = {Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are small cyanobacterial photoreceptors which are highly diversified and categorized into many lineages based on their primary sequences. In this study, we identified an atypical CBCR exhibiting an orange/green reversible photocycle. Step-by-step site-directed mutagenesis was performed on this native CBCR, and seven new photoconvertible variants were created. During this process, we identified residues crucial for each color tuning event. These seven molecules covering the shorter-wavelength blue-to-orange region would contribute to the future development of multicolored optogenetic tools and are complementary to recently developed molecules sensing longer wavelengths of light.Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are small, bistable linear tetrapyrrole (bilin)-binding light sensors which are typically found as modular components in multidomain cyanobacterial signaling proteins. The CBCR family has been categorized into many lineages that roughly correlate with their spectral diversity, but CBCRs possessing a conserved DXCF motif are found in multiple lineages. DXCF CBCRs typically possess two conserved Cys residues: a first Cys that remains ligated to the bilin chromophore and a second Cys found in the DXCF motif. The second Cys often forms a second thioether linkage, providing a mechanism to sense blue and violet light. DXCF CBCRs have been described with blue/green, blue/orange, blue/teal, and green/teal photocycles, and the molecular basis for some of this spectral diversity has been well established. We here characterize AM1_1499g1, an atypical DXCF CBCR that lacks the second cysteine residue and exhibits an orange/green photocycle. Based on prior studies of CBCR spectral tuning, we have successfully engineered seven AM1_1499g1 variants that exhibit robust yellow/teal, green/teal, blue/teal, orange/yellow, yellow/green, green/green, and blue/green photocycles. The remarkable spectral diversity generated by modification of a single CBCR provides a good template for multiplexing synthetic photobiology systems within the same cellular context, thereby bypassing the time-consuming empirical optimization process needed for multiple probes with different protein scaffolds.},
