 abstract = {Cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) is a bacterial second messenger involved in sessile/motile lifestyle transitions. We previously reported that c-di-GMP is a crucial inducer of cell aggregation of the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vulcanus. The three cooperating cyanobacteriochrome photoreceptors (SesA/B/C) regulate cell aggregation in a light color–dependent manner by synthesizing/degrading c-di-GMP. Although a variety of c-di-GMP signaling proteins are encoded in cyanobacterial genomes, how c-di-GMP signaling networks are organized remains elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the cellulose synthase Tll0007, which is essential for cell aggregation, binds c-di-GMP although the affinity is low (Kd = 63.9 ± 5.1 µM). We also show that SesA—the main trigger of cell aggregation—is subject to strict product feedback inhibition (IC50 = 1.07 ± 0.13 µM). These results suggest that SesA-produced c-di-GMP may not directly bind to Tll0007. We therefore systematically analyzed all 10 of the genes encoding proteins containing a c-di-GMP synthesis/degradation domain. We identified Tlr1612, harboring both domains, as the major repressor of cell aggregation under the repressing teal-green light irradiation. tlr1612 acts downstream of sesA and is not regulated transcriptionally by light color, suggesting that Tlr1612 may be involved in c-di-GMP amplification in the signaling cascade. Post-transcriptional control is likely crucial for the light-regulated c-di-GMP signaling.},
