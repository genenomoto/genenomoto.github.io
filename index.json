The CBCR family has been categorized into many lineages that roughly correlate with their spectral diversity, but CBCRs possessing a conserved DXCF motif are found in multiple lineages. DXCF CBCRs typically possess two conserved Cys residues: a first Cys that remains ligated to the bilin chromophore and a second Cys found in the DXCF motif. The second Cys often forms a second thioether linkage, providing a mechanism to sense blue and violet light. DXCF CBCRs have been described with blue/green, blue/orange, blue/teal, and green/teal photocycles, and the molecular basis for some of this spectral diversity has been well established. We here characterize AM1_1499g1, an atypical DXCF CBCR that lacks the second cysteine residue and exhibits an orange/green photocycle. Based on prior studies of CBCR spectral tuning, we have successfully engineered seven AM1_1499g1 variants that exhibit robust yellow/teal, green/teal, blue/teal, orange/yellow, yellow/green, green/green, and blue/green photocycles. The remarkable spectral diversity generated by modification of a single CBCR provides a good template for multiplexing synthetic photobiology systems within the same cellular context, thereby bypassing the time-consuming empirical optimization process needed for multiple probes with different protein scaffolds.","tags":null,"title":"Evolution-inspired design of multicolored photoswitches from a single cyanobacteriochrome scaffold","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Many cyanobacteria have cyanobacteria-specific photoreceptors called “cyanobacteriochromes”. I have previously revealed that the three cyanobacteriochromes cooperatively regulate Thermosynechococcus cell aggregation in a light color-sensitive manner (see e.g. Enomoto 2015).

Although a variety of c-di-GMP signaling proteins are encoded in cyanobacterial genomes, how c-di-GMP signaling networks are organized remains elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the cellulose synthase Tll0007, which is essential for cell aggregation, binds c-di-GMP although the affinity is low (Kd = 63.9 ± 5.1 µM).

Because the DXCF CBCRs from the cyanobacterium *Acaryochloris marina* vary widely in sequence, we focused on these CBCRs in this study. We identified seven DXCF CBCRs in *A. marina* and analyzed them after isolation from *Escherichia coli* that produces phycocyanobilin, a main chromophore for the CBCRs.

This observation indicated that AM1_1870g4 likely functions as a blue-light power sensor, whereas typical CBCRs reversibly sense two light qualities.

Blue/teal light-responsive SesB has only c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity, which is up-regulated by teal light and GTP. Blue/green light-responsive SesC has DGC and PDE activities. Its DGC activity is enhanced by blue light, whereas its PDE activity is enhanced by green light. A ∆*sesB* mutant cannot suppress cell aggregation under teal-green light. A ∆*sesC* mutant shows a less sensitive cell-aggregation response to ambient light. ∆*sesA*/∆*sesB*/∆*sesC* shows partial cell aggregation, which is accompanied by the loss of color dependency, implying that a nonphotoresponsive DGC(s) producing c-di-GMP can also induce the aggregation. The results suggest that SesB enhances the light color dependency of cell aggregation by degrading c-di-GMP, is particularly effective under teal light, and, therefore, seems to counteract the induction of cell aggregation by SesA. In addition, SesC seems to improve signaling specificity as an auxiliary backup to SesA/SesB activities. The coordinated action of these three CBCRs highlights why so many different CBCRs exist.","tags":[""],"title":"Three cyanobacteriochromes work together to form a light color-sensitive input system for c-di-GMP signaling of cell aggregation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

CBCRs are divided into two types based on the type of chromophore they contain: phycocyanobilin (PCB) or phycoviolobilin (PVB). PCB-binding CBCRs reversibly photoconvert at relatively long wavelengths, i.e., the blue-to-red region, whereas PVB-binding CBCRs reversibly photoconvert at shorter wavelengths, i.e., the near-ultraviolet to green region. Notably, prior to this report, CBCRs containing biliverdin (BV), which absorbs at longer wavelengths than do PCB and PVB, have not been found. Herein, we report that the typical red/green CBCR AM1_1557 from the chlorophyll *d*-bearing cyanobacterium *Acaryochloris marina* can bind BV almost comparable to PCB. This BV-bound holoprotein reversibly photoconverts between a far red light-absorbing form (Pfr, λmax = 697 nm) and an orange light-absorbing form (Po, λmax = 622 nm). At room temperature, Pfr fluoresces with a maximum at 730 nm. These spectral features are red-shifted by 48~77 nm compared with those of the PCB-bound domain. Because the absorbance of chlorophyll *d* is red-shifted compared with that of chlorophyll *a*, the BV-bound AM1_1557 may be a physiologically relevant feature of *A. marina* and is potentially useful as an optogenetic switch and/or fluorescence imager.","tags":null,"title":"A biliverdin-binding cyanobacteriochrome from the chlorophyll d-bearing cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Certain cyanobacteriochromes have been shown to regulate cellular phototaxis or chromatic acclimation of photosynthetic pigments. Some cyanobacteriochromes have output domains involved in bacterial signaling using a second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP), but its role in cyanobacteria remains elusive. Here, we characterize the recombinant Tlr0924 from a thermophilic cyanobacterium *Thermosynechococcus elongatus*, which was expressed in a cyanobacterial system. The protein reversibly photoconverts between blue- and green-absorbing forms, which is consistent with the protein prepared from *Escherichia coli*, and has diguanylate cyclase activity, which is enhanced 38-fold by blue light compared with green light. Therefore, Tlr0924 is a blue light-activated diguanylate cyclase. The protein's relatively low affinity (10.5 mM) for Mg(2+), which is essential for diguanylate cyclase activity, suggests that Mg(2+) might also regulate c-di-GMP signaling. Finally, we show that blue light irradiation under low temperature is responsible for *Thermosynechococcus vulcanus* cell aggregation, which is abolished when *tlr0924* is disrupted, suggesting that Tlr0924 mediates blue light-induced cell aggregation by producing c-di-GMP. Given our results, we propose the name \"*sesA* (sessility-A)\" for *tlr0924*. This is the first report for cyanobacteriochrome-dependent regulation of a sessile/planktonic lifestyle in cyanobacteria via c-di-GMP.","tags":[""],"title":"Cyanobacteriochrome SesA is a diguanylate cyclase that induces cell aggregation in Thermosynechococcus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

The underlying mechanisms are reasonably well understood with, in certain cases, reversible formation of an adduct between a second cysteine and the chromophore accounting, in part, for their spectral diversity. These CBCRs are denoted as dual-Cys CBCRs, and most such CBCRs had been shown to reversibly absorb blue and green light. Herein, we report the structural and mechanistic characterization of a new type of dual-Cys CBCR, AM1_1186, which exhibits reversible photoconversion between a red-absorbing dark state (λmax = 641 nm) and a blue-absorbing photoproduct (λmax = 416 nm). The wavelength separation of AM1_1186 photoconversion is the largest found to date for a CBCR. In addition to one well-conserved cysteine responsible for covalent incorporation of the chromophore into the apoprotein, AM1_1186 contains a second cysteine in a unique position of its photosensory domain, which would be more properly classified as a red/green CBCR according to its sequence. Carboxyamidomethylation and mutagenesis of the cysteines revealed that the second cysteine forms an adduct with the tetrapyrrole, the phycocyanobilin, that can be reversed under blue light. The proline immediately upstream of this cysteine appears to determine the rate at which the cysteinylation following photoexcitation of the dark state chromophore can occur. We propose a possible reaction scheme and color-tuning mechanism for AM1_1186 in terms of its structure and its place in a phylogenetic tree.","tags":[""],"title":"A new type of dual-Cys cyanobacteriochrome GAF domain found in cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina, which has an unusual red/blue reversible photoconversion cycle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

For some cyanobacteriochromes, in addition to the widely conserved cysteine to anchor the chromophore, its ligation with a second cysteine is responsible for a remarkable blue shift. Herein, we report a newly discovered cyanobacteriochrome Tlr1999 exhibiting reversible photoconversion between a blue-absorbing form at 418 nm (P418) and a teal-absorbing form at 498 nm (P498). Acidic denaturation suggests that P418 harbors C15-*Z* phycoviolobilin, whereas P498 harbors C15-*E* phycoviolobilin. When treated with iodoacetamide, which irreversibly modifies thiol groups, P418 is slowly converted to a green-absorbing photoinactive form denoted P552. The absorption spectrum of P498 appears to be unaffected by iodoacetamide, but when iodoacetamide modified, it is photoconverted to P552. These results suggest that a covalent bond exists between the second Cys and the phycoviolobilin in P418 but not in P498. Subsequent treatment with dithiothreitol converts P552 into P418, whereas dithiothreitol reduces P498 to yield P420, a photoinactive form. Site-directed mutagenesis shows that the second Cys is essential for assembly of the photoactive holoprotein and that the photoactivity of this inert mutant is partially rescued by beta-mercaptoethanol. These results suggest that the covalent attachment and detachment of a thiol, although not necessarily that of the second Cys, is critical for the reversible spectral blue shift and the complete photocycle. We propose a thiol-based photocycle, in which the thiol-modified P552 and P420 are intermediate-like forms.","tags":[""],"title":"Thiol-based photocycle of the blue and teal light-sensing cyanobacteriochrome Tlr1999","type":"publication"}]
