I love microorganisms because they are easy to handle with as a research target and also because these “lower” organism can show us their sophisticated orchestration of molecules than we “higher” organisms expect. My favorite organisms are cyanobacteria. They can grow photoautotrophically with oxygenic photosynthesis, with absorbing CO2 and emitting oxygen. They are present in various niches on the earth, such as freshwater lakes, rivers, soils, rocks, hot springs, glaciers, and oceans. For cyanobacteria, light is not only an environmental signal but also an energy source. It is not surprising if we can find cyanobacteria elegantly utilize light information. Light is obviously one of the most fundamental environmental factors to control and affect the behavior of organisms. I am studying what happens in cyanobacterial cells when they sense a light environment.\nSpecifically, I have utilized thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus as a target organism. Many cyanobacteria have cyanobacteria-specific photoreceptors called “cyanobacteriochromes”. I have previously revealed that the three cyanobacteriochromes cooperatively regulate Thermosynechococcus cell aggregation in a light color-sensitive manner (see e.g. Enomoto 2015). This light signaling involves a nucleotide second messenger molecule called “c-di-GMP”. I am now investigating how dynamic behaviors of cyanobacteriochrome proteins and c-di-GMP molecules govern the cellular lifestyle as an EMBO Long-Term fellowship project.\nI am also interested in the molecular studies in an ecology/evolution-relevant context. So far most of these analyses are done under constant cultivation conditions using axenic culture. In nature, however, any organism survives under fluctuating conditions with some “foreign friends”. It would be exciting if we can understand the behaviors and functions of molecules under their native niches.\n","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"5c724fccced683e56e6b828bbed3daf4","permalink":"https://genenomoto.github.io/project/light-signaling/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/light-signaling/","section":"project","summary":"How microorganisms see the world?","tags":[""],"title":"Light signaling in cyanobacteria","type":"project"},{"authors":["Gen Enomoto"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1563926400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563926400,"objectID":"7f1ec0e30fab45850d880de832ed75e0","permalink":"https://genenomoto.github.io/post/001-helloworld/","publishdate":"2019-07-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/001-helloworld/","section":"post","summary":"Hello World!","tags":[""],"title":"Launched my personal website.","type":"post"},{"authors":["**G.

We previously reported that c-di-GMP is a crucial inducer of cell aggregation of the cyanobacterium *Thermosynechococcus vulcanus*. The three cooperating cyanobacteriochrome photoreceptors (SesA/B/C) regulate cell aggregation in a light color–dependent manner by synthesizing/degrading c-di-GMP. Although a variety of c-di-GMP signaling proteins are encoded in cyanobacterial genomes, how c-di-GMP signaling networks are organized remains elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the cellulose synthase Tll0007, which is essential for cell aggregation, binds c-di-GMP although the affinity is low (Kd = 63.9 ± 5.1 µM). We also show that SesA—the main trigger of cell aggregation—is subject to strict product feedback inhibition (IC50 = 1.07 ± 0.13 µM). These results suggest that SesA-produced c-di-GMP may not directly bind to Tll0007. We therefore systematically analyzed all 10 of the genes encoding proteins containing a c-di-GMP synthesis/degradation domain. We identified Tlr1612, harboring both domains, as the major repressor of cell aggregation under the repressing teal-green light irradiation. *tlr1612* acts downstream of sesA and is not regulated transcriptionally by light color, suggesting that Tlr1612 may be involved in c-di-GMP amplification in the signaling cascade.

After this isomerization, various color-tuning events establish distinct spectral properties of the CBCRs. Among the various CBCRs, the DXCF CBCR lineage is widely distributed among cyanobacteria. Because the DXCF CBCRs from the cyanobacterium *Acaryochloris marina* vary widely in sequence, we focused on these CBCRs in this study. We identified seven DXCF CBCRs in *A. marina* and analyzed them after isolation from *Escherichia coli* that produces phycocyanobilin, a main chromophore for the CBCRs. We found that six of these CBCRs covalently bound a chromophore and exhibited variable properties, including blue/green, blue/teal, green/teal, and blue/orange reversible photoconversions. Notably, one CBCR, AM1_1870g4, displayed unidirectional photoconversion in response to blue-light illumination, with a rapid dark reversion that was temperature-dependent. Furthermore, the photoconversion took place without *Z*/*E* isomerization. This observation indicated that AM1_1870g4 likely functions as a blue-light power sensor, whereas typical CBCRs reversibly sense two light qualities. We also found that AM1_1870g4 possesses a GDCF motif in which the Asp residue is swapped with the next Gly residue within the DXCF motif. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that this swap is essential for the light power-sensing function of AM1_1870g4.

Replacement at the Leu294/Ile660 positions of AnPixJg2/AnPixJg4 showed the highest influence on dark reversion kinetics. AnPixJg2_DR6, wherein the six residues of AnPixJg2 were entirely replaced with those of AnPixJg4, showed a 300-fold faster dark reversion than that of the wild type.

Like the distantly related phytochromes, all CBCRs reported to date have a conserved Cys residue (the \"canonical Cys\" or \"first Cys\") that forms a thioether linkage to C31 of the linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) chromophore. Detection of ultraviolet, violet, and blue light is performed by at least three subfamilies of two-Cys CBCRs that require both the first Cys and a second Cys that forms a second covalent linkage to C10 of the bilin. In the well-characterized DXCF subfamily, the second Cys is part of a conserved Asp-Xaa-Cys-Phe motif. We here report novel CBCRs lacking the first Cys but retaining the DXCF Cys as part of a conserved Asp-Xaa-Cys-Ile-Pro (DXCIP) motif. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that DXCIP CBCRs are a sister to a lineage of DXCF CBCR domains from phototaxis sensors. Three such DXCIP CBCR domains (cce_4193g1, Cyan8802_2776g1, and JSC1_24240) were characterized after recombinant expression in *Escherichia coli* engineered to produce phycocyanobilin. All three covalently bound bilin and showed unidirectional photoconversion in response to green light. Spectra of acid-denatured proteins in the dark-adapted state do not correspond to those of known bilins. One DXCIP CBCR, cce_4193g1, exhibited very rapid dark reversion consistent with a function as a power sensor. However, Cyan8802_2776g1 exhibited slower dark reversion and would not have such a function. The full-length cce_4193 protein also possesses a DXCF CBCR GAF domain (cce_4193g2) with a covalently bound phycoviolobilin chromophore and a blue/green photocycle.

Exposure to both red and far-red light causes changes in gene expression in *P. tricornutum*, and the responses to far-red light disappear in DPH knockout cells, demonstrating that *P. tricornutum* DPH mediates far-red light signaling. The identification of DPH genes in diverse diatom species widely distributed along the water column further emphasizes the ecological significance of far-red light sensing, raising questions about the sources of far-red light.

Although large numbers of CBCR genes exist in cyanobacterial genomes, no studies have assessed whether multiple CBCRs work together. We recently showed that the diguanylate cyclase (DGC) activity of the CBCR SesA from *Thermosynechococcus elongatus* is activated by blue-light irradiation and that, when irradiated, SesA, via its product cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP), induces aggregation of *Thermosynechococcus vulcanus* cells at a temperature that is suboptimum for single-cell viability. For this report, we first characterize the photobiochemical properties of two additional CBCRs, SesB and SesC. Blue/teal light-responsive SesB has only c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity, which is up-regulated by teal light and GTP. Blue/green light-responsive SesC has DGC and PDE activities. Its DGC activity is enhanced by blue light, whereas its PDE activity is enhanced by green light. A ∆*sesB* mutant cannot suppress cell aggregation under teal-green light. A ∆*sesC* mutant shows a less sensitive cell-aggregation response to ambient light. ∆*sesA*/∆*sesB*/∆*sesC* shows partial cell aggregation, which is accompanied by the loss of color dependency, implying that a nonphotoresponsive DGC(s) producing c-di-GMP can also induce the aggregation. The results suggest that SesB enhances the light color dependency of cell aggregation by degrading c-di-GMP, is particularly effective under teal light, and, therefore, seems to counteract the induction of cell aggregation by SesA. In addition, SesC seems to improve signaling specificity as an auxiliary backup to SesA/SesB activities. The coordinated action of these three CBCRs highlights why so many different CBCRs exist.","tags":[""],"title":"Three cyanobacteriochromes work together to form a light color-sensitive input system for c-di-GMP signaling of cell aggregation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

Carboxyamidomethylation and mutagenesis of the cysteines revealed that the second cysteine forms an adduct with the tetrapyrrole, the phycocyanobilin, that can be reversed under blue light. The proline immediately upstream of this cysteine appears to determine the rate at which the cysteinylation following photoexcitation of the dark state chromophore can occur.

Acidic denaturation suggests that P418 harbors C15-*Z* phycoviolobilin, whereas P498 harbors C15-*E* phycoviolobilin. When treated with iodoacetamide, which irreversibly modifies thiol groups, P418 is slowly converted to a green-absorbing photoinactive form denoted P552. The absorption spectrum of P498 appears to be unaffected by iodoacetamide, but when iodoacetamide modified, it is photoconverted to P552. These results suggest that a covalent bond exists between the second Cys and the phycoviolobilin in P418 but not in P498. Subsequent treatment with dithiothreitol converts P552 into P418, whereas dithiothreitol reduces P498 to yield P420, a photoinactive form. Site-directed mutagenesis shows that the second Cys is essential for assembly of the photoactive holoprotein and that the photoactivity of this inert mutant is partially rescued by beta-mercaptoethanol. These results suggest that the covalent attachment and detachment of a thiol, although not necessarily that of the second Cys, is critical for the reversible spectral blue shift and the complete photocycle.
