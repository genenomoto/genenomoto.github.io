abstract: Extracellularpolysaccharides of bacteria contribute to biofilm formation,
  stress tolerance, and infectivity. Cyanobacteria, the oxygenic photoautotrophic
  bacteria, uniquely produce sulfated extracellular polysaccharides among bacteria
  to support phototrophic biofilms. In addition, sulfated polysaccharides of cyanobacteria
  and other organisms have been focused as beneficial biomaterial. However, very little
  is known about their biosynthesis machinery and function in cyanobacteria. Here,
  we found that the model cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803, formed
  bloom-like cell aggregates embedded in sulfated extracellular polysaccharides (designated
  as synechan) and identified whole set of genes responsible for synechan biosynthesis
  and its transcriptional regulation, thereby suggesting a model for the synechan
  biosynthesis apparatus. Because similar genes are found in many cyanobacterial genomes
  with wide variation, our findings may lead elucidation of various sulfated polysaccharides,
  their functions, and their potential application in biotechnology.
