abstract: The absorption of visible light in aquatic environments has led to the common
  assumption that aquatic organisms sense and adapt to penetrative blue/green light
  wavelengths but show little or no response to the more attenuated red/far-red wavelengths.
  Here, we show that two marine diatom species, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira
  pseudonana, possess a bona fide red/far-red light sensing phytochrome (DPH) that
  uses biliverdin as a chromophore and displays accentuated red-shifted absorbance
  peaks compared with other characterized plant and algal phytochromes. Exposure to
  both red and far-red light causes changes in gene expression in P. tricornutum,
  and the responses to far-red light disappear in DPH knockout cells, demonstrating
  that P. tricornutum DPH mediates far-red light signaling. The identification of
  DPH genes in diverse diatom species widely distributed along the water column further
  emphasizes the ecological significance of far-red light sensing, raising questions
  about the sources of far-red light. Our analyses indicate that, although far-red
  wavelengths from sunlight are only detectable at the ocean surface, chlorophyll
  fluorescence and Raman scattering can generate red/far-red photons in deeper layers.
  This study opens up novel perspectives on phytochrome-mediated far-red light signaling
  in the ocean and on the light sensing and adaptive capabilities of marine phototrophs.
