abstract: Cyanobacteriochromes are a spectrally diverse photoreceptor family that
  binds a bilin chromophore. For some cyanobacteriochromes, in addition to the widely
  conserved cysteine to anchor the chromophore, its ligation with a second cysteine
  is responsible for a remarkable blue shift. Herein, we report a newly discovered
  cyanobacteriochrome Tlr1999 exhibiting reversible photoconversion between a blue-absorbing
  form at 418 nm (P418) and a teal-absorbing form at 498 nm (P498). Acidic denaturation
  suggests that P418 harbors C15-Z phycoviolobilin, whereas P498 harbors C15-E phycoviolobilin.
  When treated with iodoacetamide, which irreversibly modifies thiol groups, P418
  is slowly converted to a green-absorbing photoinactive form denoted P552. The absorption
  spectrum of P498 appears to be unaffected by iodoacetamide, but when iodoacetamide
  modified, it is photoconverted to P552. These results suggest that a covalent bond
  exists between the second Cys and the phycoviolobilin in P418 but not in P498. Subsequent
  treatment with dithiothreitol converts P552 into P418, whereas dithiothreitol reduces
  P498 to yield P420, a photoinactive form. Site-directed mutagenesis shows that the
  second Cys is essential for assembly of the photoactive holoprotein and that the
  photoactivity of this inert mutant is partially rescued by beta-mercaptoethanol.
  These results suggest that the covalent attachment and detachment of a thiol, although
  not necessarily that of the second Cys, is critical for the reversible spectral
  blue shift and the complete photocycle. We propose a thiol-based photocycle, in
  which the thiol-modified P552 and P420 are intermediate-like forms.
