abstract: Cyanobacteria have unique photoreceptors, cyanobacteriochromes, that show
  diverse spectral properties to sense near-UV/visible lights. Certain cyanobacteriochromes
  have been shown to regulate cellular phototaxis or chromatic acclimation of photosynthetic
  pigments. Some cyanobacteriochromes have output domains involved in bacterial signaling
  using a second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP), but its role in cyanobacteria
  remains elusive. Here, we characterize the recombinant Tlr0924 from a thermophilic
  cyanobacterium textitThermosynechococcus textitelongatus, which was expressed in
  a cyanobacterial system. The protein reversibly photoconverts between blue- and
  green-absorbing forms, which is consistent with the protein prepared from textitEscherichia
  coli, and has diguanylate cyclase activity, which is enhanced 38-fold by blue light
  compared with green light. Therefore, Tlr0924 is a blue light-activated diguanylate
  cyclase. The protein's relatively low affinity (10.5 mM) for Mg(2+), which is essential
  for diguanylate cyclase activity, suggests that Mg(2+) might also regulate c-di-GMP
  signaling. Finally, we show that blue light irradiation under low temperature is
  responsible for textitThermosynechococcus vulcanus cell aggregation, which is abolished
  when tlr0924 is disrupted, suggesting that Tlr0924 mediates blue light-induced cell
  aggregation by producing c-di-GMP. Given our results, we propose the name \"sesA
  (sessility-A)\" for tlr0924. This is the first report for cyanobacteriochrome-dependent
  regulation of a sessile/planktonic lifestyle in cyanobacteria via c-di-GMP.
