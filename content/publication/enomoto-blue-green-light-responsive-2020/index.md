abstract: Cyanobacteriochrome (CBCRs) photoreceptors show various photochemical properties,
  but their ecophysiological functions remain elusive. Here, we report that the blue/green
  CBCRs SesA/B/C can serve as physiological sensors of cell density. Because cyanobacterial
  cells show lower transmittance of blue light than green light, higher cell density
  gives more green-light-enriched irradiance to cells. The cell-density-dependent
  suppression of cell aggregation under blue-/green-mixed light and white light conditions
  support this idea. Such a sensing mechanism may provide information about the cell
  position in cyanobacterial mats in hot springs, the natural habitat of Thermosynechococcus.
  This cell-position-dependent SesA/B/C-mediated regulation of cellular sessility
  (aggregation) might be ecophysiologically essential for the reorganization and growth
  of phototrophic mats. We also report that the green-light-induced dispersion of
  cell aggregates requires red-light-driven photosynthesis. Blue/green CBCRs might
  work as shade detectors in a different niche than red/far-red phytochromes, which
  may be why CBCRs have evolved in cyanobacteria.
