 abstract = {Phytochromes are linear tetrapyrrole-binding photoreceptors in eukaryotes and bacteria, primarily responding to red and far-red light signals reversibly. Among the GAF domain-based phytochrome superfamily, cyanobacteria-specific cyanobacteriochromes show various optical properties covering the entire visible region. It is unknown what physiological demands drove the evolution of cyanobacteriochromes in cyanobacteria. Here, we utilize ancestral sequence reconstruction and biochemical verification to show that the resurrected ancestral cyanobacteriochrome proteins reversibly respond to green and red light signals. pH titration analyses indicate that the deprotonation of the bound phycocyanobilin chromophore is crucial to perceive green light. The ancestral cyanobacteriochromes show only modest thermal reversion to the green light-absorbing form, suggesting that they evolved to sense the incident green/red light ratio. Many cyanobacteria can utilize green light for photosynthesis using phycobilisome light-harvesting complexes. The green/red sensing cyanobacteriochromes may have allowed better acclimation to changing light environments by rearranging the absorption capacity of the phycobilisome through chromatic acclimation.},
