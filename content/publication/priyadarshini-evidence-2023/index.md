abstract: Phytochromes are linear tetrapyrrole-binding photoreceptors in eukaryotes
  and bacteria, primarily responding to red and far-red light signals reversibly.
  Among the GAF domain-based phytochrome superfamily, cyanobacteria-specific cyanobacteriochromes
  show various optical properties covering the entire visible region. It is unknown
  what physiological demands drove the evolution of cyanobacteriochromes in cyanobacteria.
  Here, we utilize ancestral sequence reconstruction and biochemical verification
  to show that the resurrected ancestral cyanobacteriochrome proteins reversibly respond
  to green and red light signals. pH titration analyses indicate that the deprotonation
  of the bound phycocyanobilin chromophore is crucial to perceive green light. The
  ancestral cyanobacteriochromes show only modest thermal reversion to the green light-absorbing
  form, suggesting that they evolved to sense the incident green/red light ratio.
  Many cyanobacteria can utilize green light for photosynthesis using phycobilisome
  light-harvesting complexes. The green/red sensing cyanobacteriochromes may have
  allowed better acclimation to changing light environments by rearranging the absorption
  capacity of the phycobilisome through chromatic acclimation.
