abstract: Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) form a large, spectrally diverse family of
  photoreceptors (linear tetrapyrrole covalently bound via a conserved cysteine) that
  perceive ultraviolet to red light. The underlying mechanisms are reasonably well
  understood with, in certain cases, reversible formation of an adduct between a second
  cysteine and the chromophore accounting, in part, for their spectral diversity.
  These CBCRs are denoted as dual-Cys CBCRs, and most such CBCRs had been shown to
  reversibly absorb blue and green light. Herein, we report the structural and mechanistic
  characterization of a new type of dual-Cys CBCR, AM1_1186, which exhibits reversible
  photoconversion between a red-absorbing dark state (lambdamax = 641 nm) and a blue-absorbing
  photoproduct (lambdamax = 416 nm). The wavelength separation of AM1_1186 photoconversion
  is the largest found to date for a CBCR. In addition to one well-conserved cysteine
  responsible for covalent incorporation of the chromophore into the apoprotein, AM1_1186
  contains a second cysteine in a unique position of its photosensory domain, which
  would be more properly classified as a red/green CBCR according to its sequence.
  Carboxyamidomethylation and mutagenesis of the cysteines revealed that the second
  cysteine forms an adduct with the tetrapyrrole, the phycocyanobilin, that can be
  reversed under blue light. The proline immediately upstream of this cysteine appears
  to determine the rate at which the cysteinylation following photoexcitation of the
  dark state chromophore can occur. We propose a possible reaction scheme and color-tuning
  mechanism for AM1_1186 in terms of its structure and its place in a phylogenetic
  tree.
