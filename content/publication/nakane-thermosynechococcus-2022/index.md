abstract: Many cyanobacteria, which use light as an energy source via photosynthesis,
  show directional movement towards or away from a light source. However, the molecular
  and cell biological mechanisms for switching the direction of movement remain unclear.
  Here, we visualized type IV pilus-­dependent cell movement in the rod-s­ haped thermophilic
  cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vulcanus using optical microscopy at physiological
  temperature and light conditions. Positive and negative phototaxis were controlled
  on a short time scale of 1 min. The cells smoothly moved over solid surfaces towards
  green light, but the direction was switched to backward movement when we applied
  additional blue light illumination. The switching was mediated by three photoreceptors,
  SesA, SesB, and SesC, which have cyanobacteriochrome photosensory domains and synthesis/degradation
  activity of the bacterial second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-d­ i-­GMP). Our
  results suggest that the decision-m­ aking process for directional switching in
  phototaxis involves light-d­ ependent changes in the cellular concentration of c-­di-G­
  MP. Direct visualization of type IV pilus filaments revealed that rod-s­ haped cells
  can move perpendicular to the light vector, indicating that the polarity can be
  controlled not only by pole-­ to-­pole regulation but also within-­a-­pole regulation.
  This study provides insights into previously undescribed rapid bacterial polarity
  regulation via second messenger signalling with high spatial resolution.
