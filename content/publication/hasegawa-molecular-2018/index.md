abstract: Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are linear tetrapyrrole-binding photoreceptors
  that sense a wide range of wavelengths from ultraviolet to far-red. The primary
  photoreaction in these reactions is a Z/E isomerization of the double bond between
  rings C and D. After this isomerization, various color-tuning events establish distinct
  spectral properties of the CBCRs. Among the various CBCRs, the DXCF CBCR lineage
  is widely distributed among cyanobacteria. Because the DXCF CBCRs from the cyanobacterium
  Acaryochloris marina vary widely in sequence, we focused on these CBCRs in this
  study. We identified seven DXCF CBCRs in A. marina and analyzed them after isolation
  from Escherichia coli that produces phycocyanobilin, a main chromophore for the
  CBCRs. We found that six of these CBCRs covalently bound a chromophore and exhibited
  variable properties, including blue/green, blue/teal, green/teal, and blue/orange
  reversible photoconversions. Notably, one CBCR, AM1_1870g4, displayed unidirectional
  photoconversion in response to blue-light illumination, with a rapid dark reversion
  that was temperature-dependent. Furthermore, the photoconversion took place without
  Z/E isomerization. This observation indicated that AM1_1870g4 likely functions as
  a blue-light power sensor, whereas typical CBCRs reversibly sense two light qualities.
  We also found that AM1_1870g4 possesses a GDCF motif in which the Asp residue is
  swapped with the next Gly residue within the DXCF motif. Site-directed mutagenesis
  revealed that this swap is essential for the light power-sensing function of AM1_1870g4.
  This is the first report of a blue-light power sensor from the CBCR superfamily
  and of photoperception without Z/E isomerization among the bilin-based photoreceptors.
