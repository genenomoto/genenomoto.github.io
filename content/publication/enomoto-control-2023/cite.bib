 abstract = {Nucleotide-derived signalling molecules control a wide range of cellular processes in all organisms. The bacteria-specific cyclic dinucleotide c-di-GMP plays a crucial role in regulating motility-to-sessility transitions, cell cycle progression, and virulence. Cyanobacteria are phototrophic prokaryotes that perform oxygenic photosynthesis and are widespread microorganisms that colonize almost all habitats on Earth. In contrast to photosynthetic processes that are well understood, the behavioural responses of cyanobacteria have rarely been studied in detail. Analyses of cyanobacterial genomes have revealed that they encode a large number of proteins that are potentially involved in the synthesis and degradation of c-di-GMP. Recent studies have demonstrated that c-di-GMP coordinates many different aspects of the cyanobacterial lifestyle, mostly in a light-dependent manner. In this review, we focus on the current knowledge of light-regulated c-di-GMP signalling systems in cyanobacteria. Specifically, we highlight the progress made in understanding the most prominent behavioural responses of the model cyanobacterial strains Thermosynechococcus vulcanus and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We discuss why and how cyanobacteria extract crucial information from their light environment to regulate ecophysiologically important cellular responses. Finally, we emphasize the questions that remain to be addressed.},
