abstract: 'Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are small, bistable linear tetrapyrrole (bilin)-binding
  light sensors which are typically found as modular components in multidomain cyanobacterial
  signaling proteins. The CBCR family has been categorized into many lineages that
  roughly correlate with their spectral diversity, but CBCRs possessing a conserved
  DXCF motif are found in multiple lineages. DXCF CBCRs typically possess two conserved
  Cys residues: a first Cys that remains ligated to the bilin chromophore and a second
  Cys found in the DXCF motif. The second Cys often forms a second thioether linkage,
  providing a mechanism to sense blue and violet light. DXCF CBCRs have been described
  with blue/green, blue/orange, blue/teal, and green/teal photocycles, and the molecular
  basis for some of this spectral diversity has been well established. We here characterize
  AM1_1499g1, an atypical DXCF CBCR that lacks the second cysteine residue and exhibits
  an orange/green photocycle. Based on prior studies of CBCR spectral tuning, we have
  successfully engineered seven AM1_1499g1 variants that exhibit robust yellow/teal,
  green/teal, blue/teal, orange/yellow, yellow/green, green/green, and blue/green
  photocycles. The remarkable spectral diversity generated by modification of a single
  CBCR provides a good template for multiplexing synthetic photobiology systems within
  the same cellular context, thereby bypassing the time-consuming empirical optimization
  process needed for multiple probes with different protein scaffolds.'
