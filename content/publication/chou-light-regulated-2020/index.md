abstract: 'Photoautotrophic organisms depend on the ambient light for their growth
  and viability; therefore, it is not surprising that they utilize sophisticated lightregulated
  signaling systems to acclimate to variable light environments. Cyanobacteria are
  important primary producers that perform oxygenic photosynthesis in various environmental
  niches. Cyanobacterial genomes encode multiple and diverse photoreceptors which
  are often connected to second messenger signaling networks. Here, we review the
  current knowledge of light-regulated second messenger signaling in cyanobacteria,
  focusing on two examples: cyclic di-GMP signaling systems for regulation of Thermosynechococcus
  sessility and Synechocystis motility. We also brieï¬‚y introduce the present research
  on various nucleotide second messenger molecules, such as cAMP, cGMP, cyclic di-GMP,
  cyclic di-AMP, and the alarmone (p)ppGpp in cyanobacteria. In natural conditions,
  incident light contains a lot of different information on wavelength, intensity,
  and time scales. Further understanding of second messenger signaling in cyanobacteria
  will uncover how cyanobacteria extract the crucial information from their light
  environment to regulate cellular responses of ecophysiological importance.'
