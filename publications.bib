	abstract = {Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are cyanobacterial photoreceptors that sense near-ultraviolet to far-red light. Like the distantly related phytochromes, all CBCRs reported to date have a conserved Cys residue (the "canonical Cys" or "first Cys") that forms a thioether linkage to C31 of the linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) chromophore. Detection of ultraviolet, violet, and blue light is performed by at least three subfamilies of two-Cys CBCRs that require both the first Cys and a second Cys that forms a second covalent linkage to C10 of the bilin. In the well-characterized DXCF subfamily, the second Cys is part of a conserved Asp-Xaa-Cys-Phe motif. We here report novel CBCRs lacking the first Cys but retaining the DXCF Cys as part of a conserved Asp-Xaa-Cys-Ile-Pro (DXCIP) motif. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that DXCIP CBCRs are a sister to a lineage of DXCF CBCR domains from phototaxis sensors. Three such DXCIP CBCR domains (cce\_4193g1, Cyan8802\_2776g1, and JSC1\_24240) were characterized after recombinant expression in \textit{Escherichia coli} engineered to produce phycocyanobilin. All three covalently bound bilin and showed unidirectional photoconversion in response to green light. Spectra of acid-denatured proteins in the dark-adapted state do not correspond to those of known bilins. One DXCIP CBCR, cce\_4193g1, exhibited very rapid dark reversion consistent with a function as a power sensor. However, Cyan8802\_2776g1 exhibited slower dark reversion and would not have such a function. The full-length cce\_4193 protein also possesses a DXCF CBCR GAF domain (cce\_4193g2) with a covalently bound phycoviolobilin chromophore and a blue/green photocycle. Our studies indicate that CBCRs need not contain the canonical Cys residue to function as photochromic light sensors and that phototaxis proteins containing DXCIP CBCRs may potentially perceive both light quality and light intensity.},

Red/green-type CBCR GAF domains that photoconvert between red- (Pr) and green-absorbing (Pg) forms occur widely in various cyanobacteria. A putative phototaxis regulator, AnPixJ, contains multiple red/green-type CBCR GAF domains. We previously reported that AnPixJ's second domain (AnPixJg2) but not its fourth domain (AnPixJg4) shows red/green reversible photoconversion. Herein, we found that AnPixJg4 showed Pr-to-Pg photoconversion and rapid Pg-to-Pr dark reversion, whereas AnPixJg2 showed a barely detectable dark reversion. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed the involvement of six residues in Pg stability. Replacement at the Leu294/Ile660 positions of AnPixJg2/AnPixJg4 showed the highest influence on dark reversion kinetics. AnPixJg2\_DR6, wherein the six residues of AnPixJg2 were entirely replaced with those of AnPixJg4, showed a 300-fold faster dark reversion than that of the wild type. We constructed chimeric proteins by fusing the GAF domains with adenylate cyclase catalytic regions, such as AnPixJg2-AC, AnPixJg4-AC and AnPixJg2\_DR6-AC. We detected successful enzymatic activation under red light for both AnPixJg2-AC and AnPixJg2\_DR6-AC, and repression under green light for AnPixJg2-AC and under dark incubation for AnPixJg2\_DR6-AC. These results provide platforms to develop cAMP synthetic optogenetic tools.},

	abstract = {The absorption of visible light in aquatic environments has led to the common assumption that aquatic organisms sense and adapt to penetrative blue/green light wavelengths but show little or no response to the more attenuated red/far-red wavelengths. Here, we show that two marine diatom species, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana, possess a bona fide red/far-red light sensing phytochrome (DPH) that uses biliverdin as a chromophore and displays accentuated red-shifted absorbance peaks compared with other characterized plant and algal phytochromes. Exposure to both red and far-red light causes changes in gene expression in P. tricornutum, and the responses to far-red light disappear in DPH knockout cells, demonstrating that P. tricornutum DPH mediates far-red light signaling. The identification of DPH genes in diverse diatom species widely distributed along the water column further emphasizes the ecological significance of far-red light sensing, raising questions about the sources of far-red light. Our analyses indicate that, although far-red wavelengths from sunlight are only detectable at the ocean surface, chlorophyll fluorescence and Raman scattering can generate red/far-red photons in deeper layers. This study opens up novel perspectives on phytochrome-mediated far-red light signaling in the ocean and on the light sensing and adaptive capabilities of marine phototrophs.},

	abstract = {Cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) is a bacterial second messenger involved in sessile/motile lifestyle transitions. We previously reported that c-di-GMP is a crucial inducer of cell aggregation of the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vulcanus. The three cooperating cyanobacteriochrome photoreceptors (SesA/B/C) regulate cell aggregation in a light color–dependent manner by synthesizing/degrading c-di-GMP. Although a variety of c-di-GMP signaling proteins are encoded in cyanobacterial genomes, how c-di-GMP signaling networks are organized remains elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the cellulose synthase Tll0007, which is essential for cell aggregation, binds c-di-GMP although the affinity is low (Kd = 63.9 ± 5.1 µM). We also show that SesA—the main trigger of cell aggregation—is subject to strict product feedback inhibition (IC50 = 1.07 ± 0.13 µM). These results suggest that SesA-produced c-di-GMP may not directly bind to Tll0007. We therefore systematically analyzed all 10 of the genes encoding proteins containing a c-di-GMP synthesis/degradation domain. We identified Tlr1612, harboring both domains, as the major repressor of cell aggregation under the repressing teal-green light irradiation. tlr1612 acts downstream of sesA and is not regulated transcriptionally by light color, suggesting that Tlr1612 may be involved in c-di-GMP amplification in the signaling cascade. Post-transcriptional control is likely crucial for the light-regulated c-di-GMP signaling.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria have unique photoreceptors, cyanobacteriochromes, that show diverse spectral properties to sense near-UV/visible lights. Certain cyanobacteriochromes have been shown to regulate cellular phototaxis or chromatic acclimation of photosynthetic pigments. Some cyanobacteriochromes have output domains involved in bacterial signaling using a second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP), but its role in cyanobacteria remains elusive. Here, we characterize the recombinant Tlr0924 from a thermophilic cyanobacterium \textit{Thermosynechococcus} \textit{elongatus}, which was expressed in a cyanobacterial system. The protein reversibly photoconverts between blue- and green-absorbing forms, which is consistent with the protein prepared from \textit{Escherichia coli}, and has diguanylate cyclase activity, which is enhanced 38-fold by blue light compared with green light. Therefore, Tlr0924 is a blue light-activated diguanylate cyclase. The protein's relatively low affinity (10.5 mM) for Mg(2+), which is essential for diguanylate cyclase activity, suggests that Mg(2+) might also regulate c-di-GMP signaling. Finally, we show that blue light irradiation under low temperature is responsible for \textit{Thermosynechococcus} vulcanus cell aggregation, which is abolished when tlr0924 is disrupted, suggesting that Tlr0924 mediates blue light-induced cell aggregation by producing c-di-GMP. Given our results, we propose the name "sesA (sessility-A)" for tlr0924.

	abstract = {Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are cyanobacterial photoreceptors that have diverse spectral properties and domain compositions. Although large numbers of CBCR genes exist in cyanobacterial genomes, no studies have assessed whether multiple CBCRs work together. We recently showed that the diguanylate cyclase (DGC) activity of the CBCR SesA from \textit{Thermosynechococcus} \textit{elongatus} is activated by blue-light irradiation and that, when irradiated, SesA, via its product cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP), induces aggregation of \textit{Thermosynechococcus} vulcanus cells at a temperature that is suboptimum for single-cell viability. For this report, we first characterize the photobiochemical properties of two additional CBCRs, SesB and SesC. Blue/teal light-responsive SesB has only c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity, which is up-regulated by teal light and GTP. Blue/green light-responsive SesC has DGC and PDE activities. Its DGC activity is enhanced by blue light, whereas its PDE activity is enhanced by green light. A DeltasesB mutant cannot suppress cell aggregation under teal-green light. A DeltasesC mutant shows a less sensitive cell-aggregation response to ambient light. DeltasesA/DeltasesB/DeltasesC shows partial cell aggregation, which is accompanied by the loss of color dependency, implying that a nonphotoresponsive DGC(s) producing c-di-GMP can also induce the aggregation. The results suggest that SesB enhances the light color dependency of cell aggregation by degrading c-di-GMP, is particularly effective under teal light, and, therefore, seems to counteract the induction of cell aggregation by SesA. In addition, SesC seems to improve signaling specificity as an auxiliary backup to SesA/SesB activities. The coordinated action of these three CBCRs highlights why so many different CBCRs exist.},

For some cyanobacteriochromes, in addition to the widely conserved cysteine to anchor the chromophore, its ligation with a second cysteine is responsible for a remarkable blue shift. Herein, we report a newly discovered cyanobacteriochrome Tlr1999 exhibiting reversible photoconversion between a blue-absorbing form at 418 nm (P418) and a teal-absorbing form at 498 nm (P498). Acidic denaturation suggests that P418 harbors C15-Z phycoviolobilin, whereas P498 harbors C15-E phycoviolobilin. When treated with iodoacetamide, which irreversibly modifies thiol groups, P418 is slowly converted to a green-absorbing photoinactive form denoted P552. The absorption spectrum of P498 appears to be unaffected by iodoacetamide, but when iodoacetamide modified, it is photoconverted to P552. These results suggest that a covalent bond exists between the second Cys and the phycoviolobilin in P418 but not in P498. Subsequent treatment with dithiothreitol converts P552 into P418, whereas dithiothreitol reduces P498 to yield P420, a photoinactive form. Site-directed mutagenesis shows that the second Cys is essential for assembly of the photoactive holoprotein and that the photoactivity of this inert mutant is partially rescued by beta-mercaptoethanol. These results suggest that the covalent attachment and detachment of a thiol, although not necessarily that of the second Cys, is critical for the reversible spectral blue shift and the complete photocycle. We propose a thiol-based photocycle, in which the thiol-modified P552 and P420 are intermediate-like forms.},

After this isomerization, various color-tuning events establish distinct spectral properties of the CBCRs. Among the various CBCRs, the DXCF CBCR lineage is widely distributed among cyanobacteria. Because the DXCF CBCRs from the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina vary widely in sequence, we focused on these CBCRs in this study. We identified seven DXCF CBCRs in A. marina and analyzed them after isolation from Escherichia coli that produces phycocyanobilin, a main chromophore for the CBCRs. We found that six of these CBCRs covalently bound a chromophore and exhibited variable properties, including blue/green, blue/teal, green/teal, and blue/orange reversible photoconversions. Notably, one CBCR, AM1\_1870g4, displayed unidirectional photoconversion in response to blue-light illumination, with a rapid dark reversion that was temperature-dependent. Furthermore, the photoconversion took place without Z/E isomerization. This observation indicated that AM1\_1870g4 likely functions as a blue-light power sensor, whereas typical CBCRs reversibly sense two light qualities. We also found that AM1\_1870g4 possesses a GDCF motif in which the Asp residue is swapped with the next Gly residue within the DXCF motif. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that this swap is essential for the light power-sensing function of AM1\_1870g4. This is the first report of a blue-light power sensor from the CBCR superfamily and of photoperception without Z/E isomerization among the bilin-based photoreceptors.},

Notably, prior to this report, CBCRs containing biliverdin (BV), which absorbs at longer wavelengths than do PCB and PVB, have not been found. Herein, we report that the typical red/green CBCR AM1\_1557 from the chlorophyll d-bearing cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina can bind BV almost comparable to PCB. This BV-bound holoprotein reversibly photoconverts between a far red light-absorbing form (Pfr, lambdamax = 697 nm) and an orange light-absorbing form (Po, lambdamax = 622 nm). At room temperature, Pfr fluoresces with a maximum at 730 nm. These spectral features are red-shifted by 48{\textasciitilde}77 nm compared with those of the PCB-bound domain.

	abstract = {Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) form a large, spectrally diverse family of photoreceptors (linear tetrapyrrole covalently bound via a conserved cysteine) that perceive ultraviolet to red light. The underlying mechanisms are reasonably well understood with, in certain cases, reversible formation of an adduct between a second cysteine and the chromophore accounting, in part, for their spectral diversity. These CBCRs are denoted as dual-Cys CBCRs, and most such CBCRs had been shown to reversibly absorb blue and green light. Herein, we report the structural and mechanistic characterization of a new type of dual-Cys CBCR, AM1\_1186, which exhibits reversible photoconversion between a red-absorbing dark state (lambdamax = 641 nm) and a blue-absorbing photoproduct (lambdamax = 416 nm). The wavelength separation of AM1\_1186 photoconversion is the largest found to date for a CBCR. In addition to one well-conserved cysteine responsible for covalent incorporation of the chromophore into the apoprotein, AM1\_1186 contains a second cysteine in a unique position of its photosensory domain, which would be more properly classified as a red/green CBCR according to its sequence. Carboxyamidomethylation and mutagenesis of the cysteines revealed that the second cysteine forms an adduct with the tetrapyrrole, the phycocyanobilin, that can be reversed under blue light. The proline immediately upstream of this cysteine appears to determine the rate at which the cysteinylation following photoexcitation of the dark state chromophore can occur. We propose a possible reaction scheme and color-tuning mechanism for AM1\_1186 in terms of its structure and its place in a phylogenetic tree.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteriochrome (CBCRs) photoreceptors show various photochemical properties, but their ecophysiological functions remain elusive. Here, we report that the blue/green CBCRs SesA/B/C can serve as physiological sensors of cell density. Because cyanobacterial cells show lower transmittance of blue light than green light, higher cell density gives more green-light-enriched irradiance to cells. The cell-density-dependent suppression of cell aggregation under blue-/green-mixed light and white light conditions support this idea. Such a sensing mechanism may provide information about the cell position in cyanobacterial mats in hot springs, the natural habitat of Thermosynechococcus. This cell-position-dependent SesA/B/C-mediated regulation of cellular sessility (aggregation) might be ecophysiologically essential for the reorganization and growth of phototrophic mats. We also report that the green-light-induced dispersion of cell aggregates requires red-light-driven photosynthesis. Blue/green CBCRs might work as shade detectors in a different niche than red/far-red phytochromes, which may be why CBCRs have evolved in cyanobacteria.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are small, bistable linear tetrapyrrole (bilin)-binding light sensors which are typically found as modular components in multidomain cyanobacterial signaling proteins. The CBCR family has been categorized into many lineages that roughly correlate with their spectral diversity, but CBCRs possessing a conserved DXCF motif are found in multiple lineages. DXCF CBCRs typically possess two conserved Cys residues: a first Cys that remains ligated to the bilin chromophore and a second Cys found in the DXCF motif. The second Cys often forms a second thioether linkage, providing a mechanism to sense blue and violet light. DXCF CBCRs have been described with blue/green, blue/orange, blue/teal, and green/teal photocycles, and the molecular basis for some of this spectral diversity has been well established. We here characterize AM1\_1499g1, an atypical DXCF CBCR that lacks the second cysteine residue and exhibits an orange/green photocycle. Based on prior studies of CBCR spectral tuning, we have successfully engineered seven AM1\_1499g1 variants that exhibit robust yellow/teal, green/teal, blue/teal, orange/yellow, yellow/green, green/green, and blue/green photocycles. The remarkable spectral diversity generated by modification of a single CBCR provides a good template for multiplexing synthetic photobiology systems within the same cellular context, thereby bypassing the time-consuming empirical optimization process needed for multiple probes with different protein scaffolds.},

	abstract = {Nucleotide-derived signalling molecules control a wide range of cellular processes in all organisms. The bacteria-specific cyclic dinucleotide c-di-GMP plays a crucial role in regulating motility-to-sessility transitions, cell cycle progression, and virulence. Cyanobacteria are phototrophic prokaryotes that perform oxygenic photosynthesis and are widespread microorganisms that colonize almost all habitats on Earth. In contrast to photosynthetic processes that are well understood, the behavioural responses of cyanobacteria have rarely been studied in detail. Analyses of cyanobacterial genomes have revealed that they encode a large number of proteins that are potentially involved in the synthesis and degradation of c-di-GMP. Recent studies have demonstrated that c-di-GMP coordinates many different aspects of the cyanobacterial lifestyle, mostly in a light-dependent manner. In this review, we focus on the current knowledge of light-regulated c-di-GMP signalling systems in cyanobacteria. Specifically, we highlight the progress made in understanding the most prominent behavioural responses of the model cyanobacterial strains Thermosynechococcus vulcanus and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We discuss why and how cyanobacteria extract crucial information from their light environment to regulate ecophysiologically important cellular responses. Finally, we emphasize the questions that remain to be addressed.},

	abstract = {Photoautotrophic organisms depend on the ambient light for their growth and viability; therefore, it is not surprising that they utilize sophisticated lightregulated signaling systems to acclimate to variable light environments. Cyanobacteria are important primary producers that perform oxygenic photosynthesis in various environmental niches. Cyanobacterial genomes encode multiple and diverse photoreceptors which are often connected to second messenger signaling networks. Here, we review the current knowledge of light-regulated second messenger signaling in cyanobacteria, focusing on two examples: cyclic di-GMP signaling systems for regulation of Thermosynechococcus sessility and Synechocystis motility. We also brieﬂy introduce the present research on various nucleotide second messenger molecules, such as cAMP, cGMP, cyclic di-GMP, cyclic di-AMP, and the alarmone (p)ppGpp in cyanobacteria. In natural conditions, incident light contains a lot of different information on wavelength, intensity, and time scales. Further understanding of second messenger signaling in cyanobacteria will uncover how cyanobacteria extract the crucial information from their light environment to regulate cellular responses of ecophysiological importance.},

Among the GAF domain-based phytochrome superfamily, cyanobacteria-specific cyanobacteriochromes show various optical properties covering the entire visible region. It is unknown what physiological demands drove the evolution of cyanobacteriochromes in cyanobacteria. Here, we utilize ancestral sequence reconstruction and biochemical verification to show that the resurrected ancestral cyanobacteriochrome proteins reversibly respond to green and red light signals. pH titration analyses indicate that the deprotonation of the bound phycocyanobilin chromophore is crucial to perceive green light. The ancestral cyanobacteriochromes show only modest thermal reversion to the green light-absorbing form, suggesting that they evolved to sense the incident green/red light ratio. Many cyanobacteria can utilize green light for photosynthesis using phycobilisome light-harvesting complexes. The green/red sensing cyanobacteriochromes may have allowed better acclimation to changing light environments by rearranging the absorption capacity of the phycobilisome through chromatic acclimation.},

	abstract = {Many cyanobacteria, which use light as an energy source via photosynthesis, show directional movement towards or away from a light source. However, the molecular and cell biological mechanisms for switching the direction of movement remain unclear. Here, we visualized type IV pilus-­dependent cell movement in the rod-s­ haped thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vulcanus using optical microscopy at physiological temperature and light conditions. Positive and negative phototaxis were controlled on a short time scale of 1 min. The cells smoothly moved over solid surfaces towards green light, but the direction was switched to backward movement when we applied additional blue light illumination. The switching was mediated by three photoreceptors, SesA, SesB, and SesC, which have cyanobacteriochrome photosensory domains and synthesis/degradation activity of the bacterial second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-d­ i-­GMP). Our results suggest that the decision-m­ aking process for directional switching in phototaxis involves light-d­ ependent changes in the cellular concentration of c-­di-G­ MP. Direct visualization of type IV pilus filaments revealed that rod-s­ haped cells can move perpendicular to the light vector, indicating that the polarity can be controlled not only by pole-­ to-­pole regulation but also within-­a-­pole regulation. This study provides insights into previously undescribed rapid bacterial polarity regulation via second messenger signalling with high spatial resolution.},
